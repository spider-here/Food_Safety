      " Put all perishable foods in a cooler when travelling.Don’t pack food for a picnic if it has just been cooked and is still warm. Coolers cannot cool food enough to prevent bacteria growing. Always cover pre-prepared foods securely and keep in the refrigerator overnight. Other perishable foods and drinks, such as deli products, cooked chicken and dairy products must also be cold when put in the cooler.Always pack plenty of frozen bricks or gel packs around the food. Frozen drinks thaw quickly in warm weather and serve as extra cool bricks. Wicker baskets, unless they are insulated, are best used for non-perishables and your other picnic needs.Avoid keeping perishables such as salads, quiches and cold meats out of the fridge for longer than 4 hours before eating."

Intact steaks and whole pieces of red meat can be cooked to taste.It’s all right to leave cooked meat to remain warm on a corner of the BBQ or covered on a plate for late arrivals. Just ensure it is protected from flies and, as with cold perishables, avoid leaving it around for more than four hours, (or two hours if there are leftovers to be put into the fridge).Watch our short video about how to BBQ safely\n\nAdditional tips for BBQs at home\n\nKeep your meat in the fridge until you are ready to put it on the BBQ and keep all ready to eat food covered until you are ready to eat it. This will protect it from contamination by flies.\n\nKeep salads, patés, spreads, dips and other perishable products in the fridge until needed. It may seem like a great idea to leave food out so that guests can nibble throughout the whole day, but unfortunately bacteria will also have a feast. It’s better to divide these higher risk perishable foods into small amounts and replenish with fresh portions as required.\nIt is even more important than indoor events that you don’t mix fresh top-ups with ones that have been outside for some time where they may also have been enjoyed by flies."

      "Entertaining is fun especially during Christmas and the holiday season when you catch up with family and friends or at other times of the year during celebratory events. But preparing food for a lot of people can be risky especially when several generations get together. Young children, the elderly, those with compromised immune systems and pregnant women can be severely affected by food poisoning.\nThere are a few reasons why a party can mean a greater risk of food poisoning, including:\n\nthe average home kitchen is not designed for cooking for a lot of peopleguests often bring food to share, which means food can be out of the fridge for several hours, enough time for bacteria to multiplymany people start preparing food well ahead of an event. For some non-perishable items, such as a Christmas cake, that’s fine. But other foods, such as casseroles or desserts, need to be carefully prepared and then chilled or frozen quickly.\n\nFollow the tips below to avoid giving a gift your friends and family don’t want!Plan ahead\nSome simple planning can protect your family and friends, so talk to them early to work out who will prepare what food. Arrange to cook the riskier foods like meat and turkey on site where the Christmas dinner is going to be and use a meat thermometer to make sure it is cooked to 75°C in the thickest part of the meat.\nAsk guests who are travelling for more than an hour to bring safer foods that don’t need refrigeration or keeping hot, such as cakes, biscuits and Christmas puddings. If they like to cook they can always come earlier and help you in your kitchen. Make sure your kitchen and utensils are clean and that everyone washes and dries their hands before handling food.\nThose that live less than an hour away could bring hot food in an insulated bag but make sure it is reheated to 75°C before serving.\nThose living less than an hour away could also bring refrigerated items like salads and desserts. Refrigerated items should be packed in a cooler or esky straight from the fridge and just before leaving the house. Surround the food with ice bricks, frozen gel packs or frozen drinks. If you are having a BBQ any raw meat or poultry should be packed at the bottom of the cooler in an enclosed plastic container where it can’t drip onto other foods.\nAvoid temperature abuse\nTemperature abuse is the major cause of foodborne illness at parties and functions. Remember to minimise the time food stays in the temperature danger zone (5°C to 60°C). Learn more about the Temperature danger zone.\nKeep hot food hot – use the top of the stove or an oven turned down to just below 100°C. If you want to serve food at less than 60°C, make sure it doesn’t stay at that temperature for more than four hours.\nKeep cold food cold – if you prepare food ahead of time, and cool it in the fridge, make sure that the fridge is still operating at or below 5°C even though you’ve loaded it with extra food. Learn more about Fridge and freezer food safety.\nCool food quickly – once the steam stops rising, cover the food and put it in the fridge. You want it to cool as quickly as possible so that spores, which can survive cooking, don’t germinate. You can hasten the cooling process by pre-cooling the hot food in its container in a sink of iced or cold water or putting it into shallow containers and chilling or freezing the food in those. In deep containers it can take days for the centre of the food to reach 5 °C.\nThaw any frozen meat or meals correctly in the fridge allowing sufficient time to thaw completely (usually the day before) or in the microwave on the day of the party. Reheat food fast either on top of the stove, in the oven or in a microwave. Remember those spores are always looking for windows of opportunity to germinate and those germinate cells will grow and make your guests sick.\nThe fridge\nDomestic fridges are not very large and an overcrowded fridge or freezer does not allow the cold air to circulate freely around the food to keep them adequately frozen or chilled. When the fridge contains a large load of food, it has to work overtime to cope and, particularly if the weather is hot, the temperature inside will rise.\nYou should have a fridge thermometer inside the fridge so you can check that your fridge is operating at the correct temperature (at or under 5 °C). At these temperatures food poisoning bacteria will multiply very slowly and the food will remain safe for two or three days. Check your fridge temperature regularly, after any newly refrigerated food has had a chance to cool, and adjust the controls to lower the temperature if necessary.\nMake sure that raw meat and poultry can’t contaminate ready to eat food. Raw food can contain food poisoning bacteria. This is not a problem if the food is cooked before it is eaten. However, if these bacteria get onto ready to eat food, such as salads, desserts or foods that have already been cooked, they can cause food poisoning. Learn more about cross contamination\nYou inevitably will run out of space to allow you to do this properly, particularly if your guests are also bringing food which needs to be refrigerated until you are ready to eat, so what should you do?\nTake out the beer. Drinks can’t make you sick if they are inadequately cooled but food can. Fill the laundry sink and insulated containers or buckets with ice to keep beer and soft drinks chilled.\nGround coffee doesn’t need to be refrigerated just stored in an airtight jar.\nWhole fruit can survive in the fruit bowl or cupboard, as can whole raw vegetables.\nThose jars of pickles, chutneys and bottled sauces that have vinegar on the label can come out too because they won’t be a problem outside the fridge for a couple of days.\nIf you still don’t have enough room, make sure the things that are eaten later are in the fridge and leave out the things you will eat first.\nRemember the temperature danger zone – these foods can stay out of the fridge for up to four hours in total but must be thrown out after that.\nKeep these items at high risk of food poisoning bugs in the fridge:\ncooked meats, deli meats, patés etc. should be left in the fridge until you are ready to eat them\nsalads – especially cooked vegetable, pasta or rice salads (whether they contain meat or not)\nready to eat seafood\ndips and other ready to eat foods\ncream, egg and custard based desserts\nany dish containing raw or minimally cooked eggs, such as home made mayonnaise or sauces.\nPreparing and cooking the food\nBecause of the risks in catering for a large group, you need to be even more careful than usual about preparing food to prevent any bacteria being introduced by cross contamination.\nWash your hands before you start preparing and between preparing raw and ready to eat foods – learn about Handwashing. Wash chopping boards, knives and anything else which will come into contact with the food between preparing raw and ready to eat foods.\nCook poultry, minced meats, sausages, tenderised meats and other pre-prepared meats until they reach 75°C in the centre using a meat thermometer. No pink should be visible. Steaks and other solid pieces of meat can be cooked to your preference eg rare or medium rare – if you use a meat thermometer it will help you cook the perfect piece of meat.\nDo not allow cooked meals to cool on the bench. As soon as steam stops rising, refrigerate or freeze in a leak-proof container.\nDon’t prepare food if you have vomiting or diarrhoea (gastroenteritis) – you’ll be sure to pass it on to your family and friends.\nDon’t leave perishable nibbles, like dips and soft cheeses, out in the temperature danger zone for too long. It is better to divide them into small amounts and replenish with fresh portions as required. This also makes them look more appetising. Don’t mix fresh top-ups with ones that have been outside for some time. Low risk foods, such nuts, crisps, crackers, etc. can be topped up every hour or so.\nTurkey cooking advice\nTurkeys can be big birds and a big problem if you don’t have a plan, so before buying a huge frozen turkey, read the label! Big turkeys take several days to defrost in the fridge, not to mention hours to cook properly, so think whether you really need one a whole, big one. Ask yourself what else are you serving and consider a part turkey, such as a breast, or turkey roll − much easier to defrost and cook to perfection. If you still opt for the whole turkey and cannot source a fresh bird ask your butcher or supplier to defrost the turkey in their cool room so you can pick it up in time for Christmas and refrigerate. Whether full turkey or turkey roll, this meat must be cooked all the way through so use a meat thermometer to check that the temperature in the thickest part reaches 75°C. Because stuffing slows down cooking and cooling, it is best cooked separately.\nRaw eggs\nTrying out new recipes this time of year can be great fun but food poisoning bugs can survive and even grow quickly in foods containing raw egg, like egg nog, home made mayonnaise and desserts such as tiramisu and chocolate mousse, if they aren’t handled properly. If you are tempted to make raw eggs dishes this holiday period (like egg nog, uncooked desserts such as mousses and tiramisu, hollandaise sauces, fresh mayonnaise, aioli, health shakes with added raw egg or steak tartar) you can reduce the likelihood of illness by following the simple tips:\nDishes containing raw eggs as an ingredient, that aren’t going to be cooked before being eaten, should not be served to those vulnerable people at greater risk from food poisoning such as small children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems.\nEgg meals should be cooked for these vulnerable people until the yolk in a boiled egg has started to become firm or eggs have become set in omelets or scrambled eggs.\nCheck your eggs for visible cracks. If cracked it is safest to discard them or cook thoroughly, for example in a baked cake.\nIf you accidentally drop pieces of shell into your egg mixture, it too could be contaminated and the mixture will need thorough cooking.\nWash your hands with soap and running water and dry thoroughly before handling any food including eggs and after handling eggs or raw meat so you don’t contaminate other food.\nIf you are not going to cook the eggs further, don’t separate the yolk from the white using the shell as that could contaminate the raw egg. Invest in a plastic egg separator.\nPrepare raw egg foods just before you are going to consume them and refrigerate immediately at 5°C or below, so the bacteria cannot grow.\nKeep your eggs refrigerated in the cardboard box you purchased them in.\nLeftoversRefrigerate  or freeze leftovers immediately after the meal. Divide into small containers so they cool quickly.  If leftovers have been in the temperature danger zone for more than 2 hours they should be eaten or refrigerated immediately and for more than 4 hours they must be thrown out. Always store perishable leftovers in the fridge and use them up within two to three days. When reheating food ensure that it is hot all the way through (use a meat thermometer to ensure it is at least 75°C in the centre).\nIf you want to bring home any leftovers, ask your hosts to put your ice-bricks, gel packs or water bottles into the freezer during the party so that you can transport the leftovers home safely chilled. Put leftovers into the fridge as soon as you get home.\nStoring ham\nYour Christmas ham will keep several weeks with proper handling. After reading the packaging labels, remove it from its plastic wrap, cover it with clean cloth soaked in water and vinegar so it doesn’t dry out, and store it in the fridge below 5°C. Reduced salt hams are now becoming popular but will not last as long as conventional hams so think how much you are going to use in the next week or so and freeze some for later.";

The porous nature of wood makes it advisable to use plastic or glass chopping boards for raw meat, poultry and seafood. It is easier if you have two boards – one used only for raw food and one for cooked and ready to eat food or bread – to prevent cross contamination. All chopping boards should be scrubbed with hot water and detergent and dried after preparing raw foods. Plastic chopping boards are good as they can be washed at high water temperatures in the dishwasher. All plastic and wooden cutting boards wear out over time. Once cutting boards become excessively worn or develop hard-to-clean grooves, they should be discarded.";
  static String Contamination =
      "Cross contamination occurs when bacteria and viruses are transferred from a contaminated food or surface such as a chopping board and utensils to other food. For example, it can happen when bacteria from the surface of raw meat, poultry, seafood and raw vegetables (such as unwashed potatoes and other root vegetables), are transferred onto ready to eat foods, such as leaf and vegetable salads, rice or pasta salads, cooked meats, poultry, seafood or even fruit. The bacteria on the raw food are killed when the food is cooked, but the ready to eat food is eaten without further cooking – bacteria, viruses and all.\n\nKeep it clean\n\nHands are among the obvious culprits in transferring bacteria and viruses from raw to ready to eat food, but direct contact with soiled raw foods, dirty chopping boards, knives and other food preparation implements and containers can also spread the contamination. Chopping boards, plates and knives, blenders, mixers, bowls, or any other surface that has been in contact with raw meats, seafood and soiled vegetables and herbs needs to be carefully washed with warm water and detergent, then rinsed and thoroughly dried before being used for ready to eat foods.\n\nRaw foods\n\nCross contamination can also occur from incorrectly storing raw food in the fridge. If raw food is placed in direct contact with ready to eat foods, or if raw meat juices drip onto cooked foods, fruit and other ready to eat food, cross contamination can occur.\n\nRaw foods should always be treated as though they are contaminated. Raw food, such as meat, poultry or seafood, should be stored in a rigid leak proof container or at the bottom of the fridge to prevent it coming into direct contact with ready to eat food or to prevent meat juices or liquids dripping onto other food. Ready to eat food should be stored covered in the fridge to further reduce the risks.\n\nChopping boards\n\nIn the home it really doesn’t matter whether you have wooden, plastic or glass chopping boards so long as they are kept really clean and in good condition.

  static String Storage =
      "Fridge and freezer temperatures. Use a fridge thermometer to check if your fridge is running at 5C or below and your freezer at minus 18C or below.\n\nDate marking. The first thing to look out for is ‘best before’ or ‘use by’ dates on packaged foods Simply put: you must use (or freeze) a food by its ‘use by’ date or it could be a food safety risk while food with a ‘best before’ date will still be ok to eat after that date but it might have lost some nutrition or quality. Some foods liked canned goods with a long shelf life of more than 2 years don’t need a best before date as they last many years and it’s thought it would be used in that time. Remember to put the food you’ve just purchased at the back of the pantry or fridge so the older foods will be used first.\n\nCheck any storage instructions such as ‘keep refrigerated’ or ‘use with 3 days of opening’ as the use by/best before dates only apply to unopened food that is stored correctly. There might be foods like sauces or jams that you stored in the pantry in the past that now need refrigeration as they have less sugar or salt for health reasons.\n\nMeat and poultry. Store any fresh meat or poultry in your fridge where it can’t drip onto other foods and use or freeze by its use by date or by 3 days if it is unpackaged.  If you have defrosted too much meat or poultry then it is ok to refreeze it though it may lose some quality as freezing makes the cells break down and it becomes a little watery.\n\nVegetables should be stored in the vegetable crisper at the bottom of the fridge with the exception of potatoes which do best in a cool, dry cupboard. Don’t eat potatoes that have started to sprout as they can produce toxins that aren’t destroyed by cooking. You can use wilted veggies for soup or stock or add to casseroles.\n\nFruit.All fresh fruit, including tomatoes, should be stored outside of the fridge for better quality and washed just before you eat them. Excess fruit can be stewed and frozen and berries ‘blanched’ by dipping briefly into boiling water and then cold water and frozen on metal trays.\n\nEggs should be stored in the refrigerator still in the carton they came in to stop them picking up odours in the fridge and so you know the best before date. You can freeze excess eggs for up to a year – the easiest way is to beat them and put in a sealed container labelling them with the number of eggs and date. Defrost in the fridge and don’t use them in uncooked egg dishes. If you have your own chickens collect eggs regularly and don’t wash the eggs as this can push bacteria through the shell but wipe the eggs clean with paper towel then wash your hands with soap and water.\n\nDairy. Dairy products like milk, yoghurt and cheese should be refrigerated and used by their best before or use by date. Milk and hard cheeses can be frozen but may lose quality – grated cheese may freeze better.\n\nBread should be stored out of the fridge or it will dry out. Sliced bread can be frozen and you can defrost and use slices as you need them.\n\nBulk cooking of meals like soups, stews, curries and casseroles are a good way of using up excess food. Make sure you divide the cooked food into smaller containers (about the size of a takeaway container) as soon as it stops steaming and refrigerate or freeze. If large amounts of food cool too slowly then toxins can occur in them that can make you very ill.\n\nRefrigerated cooked dishes or leftovers should be used or frozen within 2 to 3 days or 24 hours if you are pregnant, elderly or have a poor immune system because of the risk of Listeria food poisoning. Reheat to 75 degrees Celsius using a meat thermometer or the reheat function on your microwave following any prompts such as to stir the food.\n\nFrozen food will last a long time in your freezer. It’s a good idea to label with the date it was frozen so you use the oldest first. The freezer door or lid or its manual will usually have a list of how long foods like meat, poultry, dairy, fruit and veg will last. Defrost food in the fridge or microwave not on the benchtop where food poisoning bacteria can grow. Follow any cooking instructions on packaged frozen food.";

Ask yourself what else are you serving and consider a part turkey, such as a breast, or turkey roll − much easier to defrost and cook to perfection. If you still opt for the whole turkey and cannot source a fresh bird ask your butcher or supplier to defrost the turkey in their cool room so you can pick it up in time for Christmas and refrigerate.
